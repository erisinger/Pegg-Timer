A Pebble egg timer app

The timer can be set in 30 second increments.  The top button adds 1 minute to the timer, the bottom button subtracts 30 seconds from the timer; to set a time of 1 minute and 30 seconds (1:30), press the top button twice to increase the time to 2 minutes, then the bottom button once to subtract back to 1:30.

The select button starts and pauses the timer.
